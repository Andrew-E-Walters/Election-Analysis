## Overview of Election Audit

### Assignment
We were tasked by Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission.The election commission has also requested some additional data to complete the audit. They want to know the breakdown of votes by Candidate and County. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this election audit was to gather insight on how votes were cast in the election. Through some investigation of the data we were able to see how much votes and the percentage of votes that each candidate recieved. We were also able to see the same breakdown of votes and percentage of votes that each county recieved.

### Election-Audit Summary: 
This Script can be used for future applications. 
With some tweaking, the data could tell you what percentage of votes each candidate recieved on a county basis. This could help a campaign in the future know where they should be targeting their voter outreach. They can then use the data to increase their share of votes in the future election by targeting counties where they had a small percentage of the overall vote count. 
Another application wouuld be to compare the total votes in each county to the total population of the county. Right now we only see the votes as a percentage of total votes cast. It could be benefical to know if their are certian counties that have a high or low voter turnout as a percentage of the total population.
